This project is the object-orient solution of the parking lot problem
The description of the problem is as follows:
1. There is a roboticized parking lot that has no human managers
2. There are several levels in the parking lot
3. In each level, there are several spaces for cars parking, a sensor in each space checks if there is a car parking here
